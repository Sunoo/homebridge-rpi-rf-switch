# homebridge-rpi-rf-switch
[rpi-rf](https://pypi.org/project/rpi-rf/) Plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge)

This plugin allows you to send 433MHz RF commands via HomeKit. I had no luck getting anything other than rpi-rf to communicate with my hardware. There are other plugins though, try those if this doesn't work for you.

### Installation
1. Install pip using `sudo apt install python3-pip`.
2. Install rpi-rf using `sudo pip3 install rpi-rf`.
3. Install homebridge using `npm install -g homebridge`.
4. Install this plugin using `npm install -g homebridge-rpi-rf-switch --unsafe-perm`.
5. Update your configuration file. See configuration sample below.

### Configuration
Edit your `config.json` accordingly. Configuration sample:
 ```
"platforms": [{
    "platform": "rfSwitch",
    "name": "RF Switch",
    "devices": [{
        "name" : "Outlet 1",
        "on_code": 999988851,
        "off_code": 999989622
    }, {
        "name" : "Outlet 2",
        "on_code":  379952729,
        "off_code": 379953500
    }]
}]
```

| \|- codelength     | RF code length. (Default: 24)                                                | No       |

### libpython Setting
If you are running a version of Python other than 3.7, you may need to update this value. You probably won't want to touch this unless you encounter problems. Here is how to find that value.
1. Run `python3-config --libs`.
2. You'll see something like `-lpython3.7m -lcrypt -lpthread -ldl  -lutil -lm`.
3. You want the first item listed, excluding the -l. In this example, it would be `python3.7m`.

### Note on Getting RF Codes
I've had the best luck with `RFSniffer` from the [433Utils](https://github.com/ninjablocks/433Utils) project. Your mileage may vary.
